# Deadpool
*Our hero took the name Deadpool during the time he was experimented on:  
The guards had a dead pool and gambled on which test subject would die next...  
By the way, in the comics, the white boxes are Deadpool's crazy alternative inner voice.*

Deadpool is a repository of various public white-box cryptographic implementations and their practical attacks.

The DCA attacks are leveraged by Tracer and Daredevil projects, also available at https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/,
as outlined in the paper

Attacks presented in the paper were performed partly with a proprietary tool, that we replaced by
an opensource variant (Daredevil) in order to have a completely opensource toolchain.

The DFA attacks are leveraged by JeanGrey project, also available at https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/.
